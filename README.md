# wasm_stuff
Just me messing around with Emscripten and WebAssembly and trying to get different things to work (eg. WebGL)

Don't expect there to be anything major here, its just me trying to find out how to integrate WebAssembly into JS and struggling to do so because of the lack of documentation ( or my lack of ability to find it :-) )

THe `nix/store/` directory is for the emscripten source code to be able to see it in chrome devtools using sourcemap
